# Summary
The idea for this program arose out of my need for a new laptop; the laptop I wanted was out of my budget, so I decided to track its price on amazon.com until it fell inside a price range that I could afford.

When the app is run, it scrapes the item's price from amazon. It then takes this float and compares it to my set max price; if the retrieved price is below the set maximum, an email notification is sent, otherwise, nothing happens.
# Looking Ahead
Although the logic of the program is complete and fully functional, I am working on a script (batch file) that will run the program automatically at a frequency determined by the user.
# Take-Aways
- SMTP: Before this tiny and simple project I was unfamiliar with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and python's smtplib library. They are simple and straight-forward, contrary to my previous belief.
- Web Scraping: Widened my knowledge in HTTP requests and the use of HTML tags to collect data from websites.
- *Task Automation: Learned how to automatically run a program on Windows using batch files and  Windows' Task Manager*
